# Research design

Two experiments:

1) Bias in $\hat{S}$: Control: $S$ is asked first, treatment: $P$ is asked first
2) Bias in $\hat{P}$: Control: $P$ is asked first, treatment: $S$ is asked first

- Ordering of positions is arbitrary, treatment effect may be lost when averaging
- Solution: Predict individual level counterfactual from observables (issue questions) ($S^*$)

# Model

![Distribution of distances. Distances are defined as described in the research design.\label{fig:d_dist}](../figures/main/dist_dista_dens.png)

# Preliminary Results

![Posterior distribution of the difference in means and the ratio of means in both experiments. \label{fig:mean_diff}](../figures/main/mean_diff_ratio.png)
